Abstract The following article focuses the attention on how participants in Short Term Mission ( STM ) from Norway understand the practice they have been part of. In the first part the article investigates what motivates participation in STM , and how STM is understood to be influential in life-choices. The second part of the article introduces “formation” as a theoretical lens. In this part the article investigates the working hypothesis suggesting that STM from Norway is best understood as a formative trip. The material is constructed from a survey with 153 respondents.
