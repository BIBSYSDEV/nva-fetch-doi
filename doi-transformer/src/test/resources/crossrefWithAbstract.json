    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>The following article focuses the attention on how participants in Short Term Mission (<jats:sc>STM<\/jats:sc>) from Norway understand the practice they have been part of. In the first part the article investigates what motivates participation in <jats:sc>STM<\/jats:sc>, and how <jats:sc>STM<\/jats:sc> is understood to be influential in life-choices. The second part of the article introduces \u201cformation\u201d as a theoretical lens. In this part the article investigates the working hypothesis suggesting that <jats:sc>STM<\/jats:sc> from Norway is best understood as a formative trip. The material is constructed from a survey with 153 respondents.<\/jats:p>",
